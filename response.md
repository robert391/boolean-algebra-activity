1. For question 1, I converted it to a k map. See image. Then I circled the pairs. from that, I rewrotre it as an equation.  for the second question, i used boolean algebra properites. Sone of the properties I used are complement, distributive, idempotent.
2. Some challenges in performing the lab is converting a boolean equation into its simpler form using boolean algebra.
3. for question 1: F = A'B'+A'C+B'C, for question 2: equation: i=mt'+tm'+tm, simplified equation: i=m+t
